<h1>Task</h1>
<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
<p>
    Given a global set of items \(\mathcal{I}\), 
    we define a market \(\mathbb{M}\) as the collection of its users \(U(\mathbb{M})\) together with their interactions (i.e. ratings and reviews) with items from \(\mathcal{I}\).
    Generally, a user can interact with different markets, but for simplicity, we assume that the set of users in each market are mutually disjoint with any other parallel market.
    In this competition, we have three source markets, \(\{S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3}\}\), and two target markets, \(\{T_{1}, T_{2}\}\). 
    
    The goal is to have the best possible recommender system in terms of nDCG@10 on the target markets \(\{T_{1}, T_{2}\}\).
    For that, you can use the data on these markets and also get help from the data available from the source markets \(\{S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3}\}\).
</p>

<h2>Train, Validation, and Test Split</h2>
<p>
    The source markets are used for training, and therefore they are provided in a single <b>Train</b> split.
    For the target markets, we leave one interaction of each user out for the <b>Test</b> split, and one other interaction for the <b>Validation</b> split. All the remaining interactions are given as the <b>Train</b> split. As usual, you are given only the Train and Validation splits.
</p>

<h2 id=submissions>Submissions</h2>
<p>
    Your submissions should be two tab separated files (<mark><code>target_1.scores.tsv</code></mark> and <mark><code>target_2.scores.tsv</code></mark>) with each line containing three columns as follows:

    <p><code>
        userId	itemId	score
    </code></p>
    where the first column <code>userId</code> is the user unique id, the second column <code>itemId</code> is the item unique id, and the third column <code>score</code> is the score your model assigns to this (user, item) pair.
    For example, each of your <mark><code>.score.tsv</code></mark> files should look like this:
    <p><code>
        VA	E2	1.0 
        VA	FQ	0.9 
        VA	WS	1.1
        ...
    </code></p>
    For each user (i.e. each unique value for <code>userId</code>), the items are sorted based on their score in a descending order (equal scores are handled randomly) and the top 10 items in the ranked list are used for <a href=evaluation.html>evaluation</a>.
</p>
