<h1 id="Evaluation">Evaluation</h1>
<p>
    We evaluate the submissions based on their average nDCG@10.
    As discussed in <a href=Task.html#:~:text=For%20each,randomly)>submission guidlines</a>, the scores of items are sorted for each user and the top 10 items are considered for evaluation.
    For the total evaluation, we concatenate the users of the target markets (<mark><code>target_1.scores.tsv</code></mark> and <mark><code>target_2.scores.tsv</code></mark>) and compute the nDCG@10 on the resulting list. The teams are ranked based on this metric.
    <br>
    For information purposes we also report separate nDCG@10 and HR@10 for each target market, too.
