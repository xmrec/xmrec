<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The training and validation as well as the test run can be downloaded <a href="#">here</a>.
<p>The data is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are three folders 
        <mark><code>source_1</code></mark>,
        <mark><code>source_2</code></mark>, and 
        <mark><code>source_3</code></mark>;
        containing the data of the source markets. Inside each, the following file can be found:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <mark><code>train.tsv</code></mark>: A tab separated file, containing the <b>Training</b> data with the following format:
                <p><code>
                    userId	itemId	rating
                </p></code>
                where the first column <code>userId</code> is the user unique id, the second column <code>itemId</code> is the item unique id, and the third column <code>rating</code> is the rating (an integer ranging from 1 to 5).
                This means that our training data only contains the <b>positive</b> samples. All the other (user, item) pairs are unknown and can be considered <b>negative</b> during training.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        There are two folders
        <mark><code>target_1</code></mark>, and 
        <mark><code>target_2</code></mark>; containing the data of the target markets. Inside each, the following files can be found:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <mark><code>train.tsv</code></mark>: 
                A tab separated file, containing the <b>Training</b> data with <code>userId</code>, <code>itemId</code>, and <code>rating</code> fields the same as above.
            </li>
            <li>
                <mark><code>valid_qrel.tsv</code></mark>:
                The <b>Validation positive</b> samples, with a structure similar to the <mark><code>train.tsv</code></mark>.
                As discussed <a href="Task.html#:~:text=For%20the%20target%20markets,%20split."> here</a>, the validation set only has one positive sample per user.
            </li>
            <li>
                <mark><code>valid_qrun.tsv</code></mark>:
                The <b>Validation</b> samples. For consistency of results between different teams, we provide you 99 negative samples for each unique <code>userId</code> as follows:
                <p><code>
                    userId	itemId1,itemId2,...,itemId100
                </code></p>
                where the two columns are separated by a tab and the list of items are separated by commas. There are 99 negative samples and 1 positive sample (identified in the <mark><code>valid_qrel.tsv</code></mark> file) in the list. Your model should rerank these 100 items per user.
            </li>
            <li>
                <mark><code>test_qrun.tsv</code></mark>:
                The <b>Test candidate</b> samples. As is common in recommendation systems, we provide you 100 candidate items for each unique <code>userId</code> as follows:
                <p><code>
                    userId	itemId1,itemId2,...,itemId100
                </code></p>
                where the two columns are separated by a tab and the list of negative items are separated by commas.
                These 100 items should be reranked by your models and the top 10 items for each user should be reported with their scores.
                As discussed <a href="Task.html#:~:text=For%20the%20target%20markets,%20split."> here</a>, only one item from this list of 100 items is a positive sample and the rest 99 items are negative samples.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
