# XMRec: First Workshop of Cross-Market Recommendation @ RecSys 2021

## Overview
Online markets are spreading quickly across the globe, supporting a huge network of product sales to billions of customers with various cultures, lifestyles, economic interests, and languages. These global markets introduce many novel opportunities -- as well as challenges. Our workshop, called XMRec, concerns the problem of recommending relevant products to users in a target market (e.g., a resource-scarce market) by leveraging data from similar high-resource markets, e.g. using data from the U.S. market to improve recommendations in a target market. We hypothesize that data from one market can be used to improve recommendation in another.
We aim to create a dynamic and interactive atmosphere where researchers of diverse backgrounds and interests can discuss their ideas on cross-market recommendation and how it can be further pursued in the community. 
To this end, XMRec features a series of seed talks both from industry and academia, discussing the future of cross-market recommendation and its potentials as a new line of research. The seed talks will be followed by a panel discussion where a diverse set of researchers discuss their ideas and opinion about the topic. Finally, we will invite the participants and the panelists to take part in interactive brainstorming breakout sessions to further discuss their ideas. 
We aim to motivate a range of studies (like analyzing market-specific biases, conversational recommendation, and predicting early adopters)  beyond the cross-domain recommendation by extending markets and content languages.

If you are using Overleaf, you can use the following code (\documentclass[manuscript]{acmart}). The review process is single-blind, handled electronically through EasyChair. Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings and at least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop. Accepted papers are given a poster presentation slot at the workshop.  The ideal length of a paper for the XMRec workshop is between 4-8 pages (excluding references). 
 
Submission Page: [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xmrec21)

The following paper categories are welcome:
- research papers on novel, original, and unpublished work (pre-prints submitted to ArXiv are eligible). **Max length: 8 pages, plus references**
- position and prospective papers. **Max length: 8 pages, plus references**
- extended abstracts summarizing published results. **Max length: 4 pages, plus references**

All accepted works will be presented at the workshop. Moreover, the research papers can be included in an open-access post-proceedings volume of CEUR Workshop Proceedings [http://ceur-ws.org/](http://ceur-ws.org/).

## Topics
The workshop topics include but are not limited to:

 - **Machine Learning Approaches:** research focusing on the application of various machine learning approaches for knowledge transfer such as domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, data augmentation, meta-learning, and knowledge distillation for the cross-market recommendation.
 - **Cross-Domain & Cross-Market Recommendation:** research focusing on both cross-domain and cross-market techniques.   
 - **Data Selection & Augmentation:** research on data selection or augmentation techniques (e.g., from the resource-rich markets) for cross-market training of models.
 - **Market Similarity Measurement:** research on measuring and selecting similar markets to apply market adaptation and/or cross-market training.   
 - **Market-Specific Bias:** research on potential biases existing in various markets that could affect the cross-market recommendation.   
 - **Cross-Lingual Content-Based Recommendation:** research focusing on leveraging cross-lingual content for recommendation such as item descriptions and user reviews.   
 - **Cold-Start Recommendation:** research on leveraging interactions from warm-start markets to address the cold-start problem in other markets.
 - **Resource:** works describing resources that can foster research on the cross-market recommendation.
